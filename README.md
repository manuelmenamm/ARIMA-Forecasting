# ARIMA-Forecasting
Forecasting Spanish unemployment and inflation rate. 
This project uses ARIMA to forecast the unemployment and inflation rate in Spain, using the R programming language. Throughout the notebook, key steps to forecasting are used, beginning with rendering the time series stationary, fitting various ARIMA models with different orders of pdq and PDQ, and lastly testing to find the best model through cross validation.
